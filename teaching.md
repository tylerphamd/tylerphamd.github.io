### Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy is centered on helping students bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Because communication courses can often feel theory-heavy, I design materials and activities that demonstrate how concepts manifest in real-world contexts. By incorporating diverse lecture content alongside hands-on activities, I minimize lecture time and provide students with more opportunities to actively apply course theories in practice. Equally important to me is fostering a classroom grounded in humanity and empathy. Having taught students from diverse backgrounds, I recognize that each learner brings unique circumstances to the classroom. I strive to accommodate individual needs while upholding the learning objectives of my courses, creating an environment where all students feel supported and capable of success.

### Philosophy in Practice
I emphasize the connection between knowledge and practice by integrating hands-on activities into my teaching. In Organizational Communication, for instance, I design materials around leadership theories such as Theory X/Theory Y and Leader-Member Exchange Theory. To help students see the relevance of these concepts, I have them interview industry leaders about how they enact leadership in the workplace, then analyze the data in relation to the theories discussed in class. Similarly, in Public Speaking, I incorporate a variety of short speaking activities—such as impromptu speeches and elevator pitches—that give students opportunities to apply course concepts. These exercises allow students to practice effective oral communication while reinforcing lessons on verbal and nonverbal delivery.
Flexibility and empathy are central to my teaching philosophy, as they create a learning environment where students feel supported and engaged. For example, I accommodate pregnant students by allowing them to make up assignments or submit video presentations from home. I also adapt presentation audiences for students experiencing anxiety to reduce discomfort and build their confidence. These practices reflect my commitment to equity and my belief that students are most successful when they are given the tools and encouragement to thrive. As a result, my students maintain consistent attendance, develop meaningful connections with both peers and myself, and demonstrate strong progress throughout the course. I have also had the privilege of writing letters of recommendation for students who went on to secure graduate school admissions and scholarships, further reinforcing the value of a supportive and inclusive classroom.

### Student Feedback ###
COM 100 (Michigan State University)

"Tyler was so great! He understood the material and cared deeply about all his students. He was understanding that not everyone's schedule worked well with some of the deadlines and made sure every student had a chance to succeed."

"The class was organized really well. The TA was absolutely amazing!!! Best TA ive ever had."

COM 240 (Michigan State University)

“I really enjoyed Tyler Pham as my TA. He was easy going on us students and understanding of any situation. He helped clarify all assignments and exams.”

“I liked how recitation was able to tie back to the lecture and re–iterate the main points.”

COM 310 (Michigan State University)

“Overall I appreciated the effort that Professor Pham put into the course. He clearly has a passion for the material he teaches. I also very much enjoyed the variety of ways attendance points were given through the in class activities. These activities allowed us to interact with other students which is a great way to keep people engaged. Having "guest" professors was also interesting when it came to learning the class material. The homework material was on topic to the class material, and exam material.”

COM 225 (Michigan State University)

“This team was absolutely amazing, but Tyler deserves some major props. A ton of students kept asking questions answered in the syllabus and he was extremely patient with all of them. He also brought some spectacular energy.”

“I loved this class! This was one of the best classes that I had this semester. I enjoyed all of the material, the way the class was taught, and I also love learning all about interpersonal communication. I wish I could take this course all over again just to learn it some more.”

COMM 120 (Lansing Community College)

“I very much appreciated how communicative the professor was, he kept us informed and up to date with all of the announcements and expectations. Great instructor for this course and super grateful I took it with professor Pham.” 

“Amazing person! He is very kind and gracious and he makes things very clear and not confusing.”

COMM 130 (Lansing Community College)

“Tyler is an awesome professor. He was very fair in grading, the expectations he set from day 1 were kept and fair, and he was very clear when instructing and providing me feedback on speeches, activities, and assignments. He was also just a fun professor that wanted to learn about each student and cared about us doing well. Grades were posted very quickly so I always knew where I was at. I would recommend him as a professor 10/10 times.”

"Professor Pham is an exceptional example of a great teacher. He clearly loves what he does, is passionate about the subject, and always gave us a perfect example of a confident and compelling public speaker. As a side note, Professor Pham was my best dressed professor by far. You may not consider this an incredibly important and otherwise deal–breaking factor of an effective professor, but I consider a well–dressed professor one that respects his profession and his students in every way he can, including the way he dressed for his class."

COMM 200 (Lansing Community College)

"Perfect role model for a professor and how they should structure their class. Empathetic, caring, patient, reasonable. I wish they could teach all my collegiate classes."
