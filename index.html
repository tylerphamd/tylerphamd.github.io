<p> I am a Ph.D candidate in Communication at Michigan State University looking for full-time work opportunities in statistics, data analytics, and quantitative research, including academic and industry opportunities. I currently hold teaching positions at Michigan State University and Lansing Community College, where I teach a variety of Communication courses. I was also a statistical consultant for the Center for Statistical Training and Consulting (CSTAT) at Michigan State University in 2023 and held a Technology internship at Hilton Corporate office in Dallas, Texas in 2024. Want to chat about research, consulting work, graduate school, and more? Reach out to me at phamduy@msu.edu. I look forward to connecting with you.

<p> My research integrates theories of interpersonal communication and social psychology to examine how individuals process information in mediated contexts. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, I investigate how people form impressions of others through technology and how these perceptions shape subsequent behaviors.
