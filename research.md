### Using experimental designs to understand sender's effect in mediated interactions
What if what we say can influence how we think and feel about a stranger? I am interested in exploring how we can basically talk ourselves into liking or disliking a person. Guided by the hyperpersonal model and identity shift theory of computer-mediated communication, I designed an experiment to test the effects of sending evaluative statements on the senders' impression of the target. I demonstrated that sending positive evaluative messages to a partner’s selective self-presentation can improve the sender’s attitude toward that recipient, while negative evaluative messages can diminish it. This project is now published in Media Psychology. Read the article [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15213269.2024.2418641#abstract).

### Advancing our understanding of cognitive processes in mediated interactions
Does cognitive load diminish our impression formation process? Guided by metacognition scholarship and feeling-as-information theory, I examined the relationship between multitasking, processing fluency, and impression of the target. Our study revealed that multitasking can increase the perceived difficulty of a communication task, which in turn impedes individuals’ ability to form impressions of their partner. This project is now published in Communication Studies. Read the article [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10510974.2025.2486608).

### Using reaction time to understand impression formation
CMC scholars have been using attitudes as a mechanism to test interpersonal impression formation. If that is case, does attitude accessibility play a role in this process? To answer this question, I designed a lab experiment that investigated the relationship between the valence of impression toward the conversation partner and impression formation outcomes, with attitude accessibility as a mediator (measured through a reaction time task). We found that being positive toward a conversation partner enhances the accessibility of attitudes toward that target, whereas negativity reduces accessibility. This project is under review in Computers in Human Behavior.
